General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, 
is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 
and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. 
General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of 
universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric 
property of space and time or four dimensional spacetime. 
In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and 
momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified 
by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.

Some predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of classical 
physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the 
motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such 
differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the 
gravitational redshift of light, the gravitational time delay and 
singularities or black holes. The predictions of general relativity in relation to 
classical physics have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date.
Although general relativity is not the only relativistic theory of gravity, it is 
the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, 
unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity 
can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and 
self consistent theory of quantum gravity, how gravity can be unified with the 
three nongravitational forces - strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and electromagnetic 
force.
